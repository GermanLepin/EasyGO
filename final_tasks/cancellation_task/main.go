package main

// Write a program that uses a channel to signal
// the cancellation of goroutines. Create multiple
// goroutines that do some work (e.g., count to a
// large number), and when a cancel signal is sent,
// they should stop their execution gracefully.

// These exercises cover various aspects of goroutines
// and channels in Go, including basic concurrency,
// channel direction, select statements, fan-out,
// fan-in patterns, worker pools, pipelines, and
// goroutine cancellation. They can help assess a
// student's understanding and practical skills in
// concurrent programming with Go.
